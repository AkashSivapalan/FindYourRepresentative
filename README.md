# FindYourRepresentative

This is a web application that takes in user’s address and returns the representative for the area. I created RESTful service which integrates with Google Maps API to get latitude and longitude from the user’s address and the Represent Civic Information API to retrieve representative information. The web page interface uses HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

To run this project, all you need is the representativeWebPage.html file. The java files that are used in the backend and are here if any viewers wanted to reference it.
